# DBMS-project
This group project was done under the DBMS course taken by me in the college.
This database stores
information about plot owners and the facilities they use of the 
colony they are residing in. Ecological factors such as contribution to 
preserve the greenery and cleanliness is to be measured. Hence 
maintenance fee is calculated.
